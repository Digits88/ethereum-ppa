Description: This C++ library provides a json-rpc (remote procedure call)
 framework for Linux and MacOS (or any other UNIX derivate). It is fully JSON-
 RPC 2.0 compatible (JSON-RPC 2.0) and provides additional features, such as
 generic authentication mechanisms.
 .
 This package contains the header files needed for developing using
 the JSON-RPC library with libtool support.
